# HELVE LOGS - Live Documentary Series / Live Documentation Series
The overarching purpose of Helve Logs is to document the processes and day to day life at Helve AVR high technology creative agency. We aim to experiment with creative methods, showcase new technologies and promote the concept of 'visual hacking' of the reality. 

*Content intended for widespread publication (all relevant social platforms, adjusted to specific conditions of a platform). Insert a list of pieces of content (optimal 100+ pieces of content a day?) divided by platform, type and actual body content settings. There is a shitload of data I wrote down.*

**TRANSCRIBE ALL NOTES!**

## Video intro for Instagram and vlogs [Helve Logs]

Tracking, identity, privacy theme.

USE BINAURAL SOUNDS IN BG_

The four known categories of frequency pattern include:

- Delta patterns: Binaural beats in the delta pattern are set at a frequency of between 0.1 and 4 Hz, which is associated with dreamless sleep.
- Theta patterns: Binaural beats in the theta pattern are set at a frequency of between 4 and 8 Hz, which is associated with sleep in the rapid eye movement or REM phase, meditation, and creativity.
- Alpha pattern: Binaural beats in the alpha pattern are set at a frequency of between 8 and 13 Hz, which may encourage relaxation.
- Beta pattern: Binaural beats in the beta pattern are set at a frequency of between 14 Hz and 100 Hz, which may help promote concentration and alertness. However, this frequency can also increase anxiety at the higher end of the frequency range.

START_FRAME comes back for sure.

Tracked usernames on screen, attached next to head. "MOTHNODE_" or "?" at unknown. Recurring theme.
Use the downloaded stock hacker style visuals for something.

A third pops up from the left (white triangle) with Brief Title of the scene, Location and live clock.

Overlay with a heart/like (depending on the platform) and arrow pointing below the video content.

**Ideas**
- vlogs fisheye/tracking vibe/broadcast/uplink established -- projects and narratives cinematic.
- sequence starts with a date "/// 2019" as if it was a flashback.
- at the end of the video follow / sub / like variations glitch in (depending on the platform it is shared on).
- all the docs are black and white (real life), while the experiences get colorful (especially actual project stuff).
